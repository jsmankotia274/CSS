      <p>The Magikill Minions are units owned by the Order. These small, dwarf-like creatures are summoned by the Magikill, and are widely known for their disposability and low survivability rate. However, if used in the right manner, the Magikill Minions can be used to wipe the field clean.Originally part of the Magikill Empire, the Magikill Minions appeared in the original Stick War (and Stick War: Legacy) as an instrument of the army, but after the collapse and the supposed extinction of the empire, not a single Minion was left. Later on when the Magikill reappears in Stick War II: Order Empire, the Magikill Minions are nowhere to be seen.Magikill Minions, since they're just smaller Swordwrath, are likely followers of the 'Way of the Sword' just the same.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <section class="line"></section>
      <h3>Stick War</h3>
      <h4>Attack the Magikill</h4>
      <p>During their first encounter with the Order, the minions were summoned by their masters to hold and overtake the enemy monument. However after some exchange of weaponry, the Magikill were overwhelmed and their statue fell. This crippled the empire, but they weren't gone yet.</p>
      <section class="line"></section>
      <h4>Last Stand</h4>
      <p>After their Order acquired their technologies and ravaged their homefront, the remaining Magikill and their minions composed themselves into some semblance of a force and helped in an attempt to defeat the Order and get their revenge. However, these forces too were still not enough, and they were killed anyway.</p>

      <h2>Appearence</h2>
      <section class="line"></section>
      <p>The Magikill Minion wears no clothing, as replicating the likes of the Swordwrath. The Minion wields a small pitchfork, and is slightly smaller than the average unit.</p>
      <h2>Strengths</h2>
      <section class="line"></section>
      <p>The Magikill Minion, summoned from the Magikill, costs virtually no gold or population. Along with being completely free, the Magikill Minion is a somewhat strong offensive unit. The ability to overwhelm single units with sheer numbers is useful, as well as the fact that speed upgrades placed onto your Swordwrath applies to the Magikill Minion too.</p>
      <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
      <section class="line"></section>
      <p>The Magikill Minion unit is weak in defenses and health, along with losing against any unit in the game.</p>
